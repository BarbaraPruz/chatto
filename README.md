# chatto
Just having fun here!  Chatto is a simple chat app.

Implementation conists of a Rails backend and React frontend.

In the master branch, chat messages are updated through polling logic.  In the WebSockets
branch, the polling is replaced with websockets using Active Cable.  Note that the WebSockets branch in not deployed to Heroku (requires moving to wss and because no paid
dynos are used, it would be additional cost).

# Installation Instructions
